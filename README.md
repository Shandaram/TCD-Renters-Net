# TCD Renters Solidarity Network

The TCD Renters Solidarity Network website is a responsive and accessible platform developed to support tenant rights and organize renter solidarity activities. As part of a team, I managed the project lifecycle, client communication, and design of specific pages, while leading the development using Vue.js and integrating it with a Drupal CMS. The site features intuitive navigation, dynamic News and Events sections, and adheres to inclusive design practices. It is available in three screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop). This project was made in collaboration with TCD Student Union.

The project was a collaborative effort, where I assumed roles as both project manager and technical lead.
